## 📊 Features

- 🧹 Clean and structure large CSV datasets (climate data)
- 📈 Visualizations using Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
- 📓 Interactive notebook for air quality & temperature analysis
- 🗂️ Multiple granularity levels: Country, State, City
- 📦 Git LFS used for large file storage

---

## 📦 Datasets Used

All datasets are sourced from [Berkeley Earth](http://berkeleyearth.org/) and preprocessed into:

- `GlobalTemperatures.csv`
- `TemperaturesByCountry.csv`
- `TemperaturesByMajorCity.csv`
- `TemperaturesByState.csv`

> Note: Datasets are tracked using **Git LFS** due to size.
